# AIRE - AI Driven Requirements Engineering

The business world is constantly evolving, which means that organisations using and creating software must adapt to stay competitive. However, keeping up with the rapidly changing landscape can be difficult. Thatâ€™s where artificial intelligence (AI) comes in. This framework shows how AI can enhance the requirements engineering process, giving businesses a competitive edge. **AI driven requirements engineering** can help organizations make better decisions and implement policies more effectively by providing them with more accurate, comprehensive, and timely information. Several examples show a successful application of AI in requirements engineering.

Requirements engineering is a crucial process in any software development project. It involves identifying, analysing, validating, prioritizing, and documenting the requirements for the project to ensure its successful completion. As software systems become increasingly complex, the need for an efficient and effective requirements engineering process becomes more critical. The core concept of AI-driven requirements engineering is based on breaking down the requirements engineering process into smaller, well-defined tasks with clear target criteria. By doing this, these tasks can be automated using AI technology, improving the efficiency and accuracy of the requirements engineering process. The illustration below outlines five main steps of requirements engineering, their target criteria, and some specific tasks involved in each step. The number and sequence of process steps might vary from project to project.
