## Evolution of Requirements Engineering

The evolution of requirements engineering has been driven by a variety of factors, including changes in technology, development methodologies, and stakeholder expectations. Requirements engineering emerged in the 1980s alongside structured software development methodologies and the introduction of requirement specification and analysis techniques. 
In the 1990s, requirements engineering evolved and became standardized, with a focus on traceability and validation. Standards and best practices, such as IEEE 830 and V-Model, were developed during this time. 
The 2000s saw the emergence of agile development methodologies that emphasized collaboration and flexibility in requirements gathering. User-centred design and requirements engineering were also emphasized during this time, using methods such as personas and user stories. 
As we moved into the 2010s, the importance of DevOps, continuous delivery, and non-functional requirements grew. Automated testing and continuous integration tools were increasingly used for requirements validation. 
Looking forward to the 2020s, there is a growing interest in AI-powered requirements engineering, where a data-centric approach is taken to support the ability to iterate on software requirements. Overall, requirements engineering has evolved over the years, adapting to changes in technology and development methodologies to ensure that software solutions truly meet the needs and expectations of stakeholders. By understanding these challenges and forces, organisations can better design and develop AI-driven requirements engineering approaches that meet the needs of stakeholders and help address these challenges.

## Process and Core Concept


Requirements engineering is a crucial process in any software development project. It involves identifying, analysing, validating, prioritizing, and documenting the requirements for the project to ensure its successful completion. As software systems become increasingly complex, the need for an efficient and effective requirements engineering process becomes more critical.
The core concept of AI-driven requirements engineering is based on breaking down the requirements engineering process into smaller, well-defined tasks with clear target criteria. By doing this, these tasks can be automated using AI technology, improving the efficiency and accuracy of the requirements engineering process.
The table below outlines five main steps of requirements engineering, their target criteria, and some specific tasks involved in each step. The number and sequence of process steps might vary from project to project.

| Process Step | Target Criteria  | Example of Tasks                                 |
|:-------------|:---------------|:------------------------------------------------|
| 1. Identify  | Relevance      | Research similar projects                     |
|              |                | Conduct stakeholder interviews                 |
|              |                | Create user personas                          |
| 2. Analyze   | Completeness   | Identify conflicts in requirements             |
|              | Correctness    | Check for missing information                  |
|              | Consistency    | Compare requirements to user needs             |
| 3. Validate  | Necessity      | Quantify requirement metrics                   |
|              | Achievability  | Measure requirement quality                    |
|              | Practicability | Test requirement feasibility                   |
| 4. Prioritize| Importance     | Filter similar requirements                    |
|              |                | Select top-priority requirements               |
|              |                | Explain prioritization visually                |
| 5. Document  | Discoverability| Simplify language used in requirements document|
|              | Understandability| Summarize the most essential information      |
|              | Usability      | Add graphics and visual aids                    |



The first step in requirements engineering is identifying the needs and expectations of stakeholders involved in the project. This involves researching similar projects and conducting interviews to create user personas that reflect the needs of stakeholders. All requirements should be in line with the project's goals, objectives, and aligned with stakeholder needs.
Analysing the gathered information is the second step in requirements engineering. During this phase, requirements are carefully examined to identify any conflicts, contradictions, or missing information. This helps ensure that all requirements are in sync with the stakeholder needs and the project goals.
The third step in the requirements engineering process is validating the requirements. Here, the requirements are reviewed and validated to make sure they are complete, accurate, and consistent with each other. AI technology can support this process by quantifying requirement metrics, measuring requirement quality, and testing for requirement feasibility.




Prioritizing the requirements is the fourth step in the requirements engineering process. During this phase, the requirements are ranked according to their significance and assigned priority levels. AI-driven requirements engineering can filter similar requirements, select top-priority requirements, and visually explain prioritization.
Finally, the last step in the process is documenting the requirements. This involves creating a concise and easy-to-understand document that can be referred to during the project's development. To make this process easier, AI technology can simplify the document's language, summarize essential information, and add visual aids to ensure that all stakeholders can understand and use the requirements document.
The core concept of AI-driven requirements engineering is that by breaking down the requirements engineering process into smaller tasks with clear target criteria, these tasks can be automated using AI technology. This approach improves the efficiency and accuracy of the requirements engineering process, reducing the risk of errors and rework.

## Success Story for Use in Business

A German IT service provider recently faced a challenge related to a mandatory security concept: they needed to analyze and consolidate over 1100 complex security requirements before a looming deadline. This task was too time-consuming and complex for the team to tackle manually, so we recommended to automate the process using AI-driven requirements engineering.
In just three months, we developed and implemented advanced NLP-based similarity analysis and graph-based dependency analysis techniques, enabling them to consolidate the security requirements with ease. We also conducted a feasibility study for requirements validation and user story creation based on advanced AI, using various experiments with large language models. While the results were convincing, security concerns related to the use of publicly available language models meant the client put the study on hold.

Overall, the use of AI-driven requirements engineering was a resounding success. Thanks to their advanced graph visualization and consolidation of requirements into an Excel-format, we were able to reduce redundant requirements and streamline implementation. Importantly, this led to a significant reduction in expected manual labor, estimated to be over 50%, resulting in cost savings and operational optimizations.
In summary, the project is a testament to the power of AI-driven requirements engineering in improving business operations. By leveraging automation and cutting-edge tools and techniques, companies can simplify complex processes, save valuable time and resources, and ultimately achieve better outcomes.

## Case Study: Translating Law into Requirements

Challenge: Translating laws into functional requirements can be a complex and time-consuming task. Laws are often lengthy and complex documents with interdependent paragraphs and sections, making it difficult to extract key information and convert them into actionable requirements. This process can also be error-prone, leading to potential legal and ethical implications.
Solution: AI-driven requirements engineering provides a solution to the above challenges by leveraging modern language models such as GPT-3 to effectively extract key information from laws and transform them into functional requirements. The process involves identifying relevant paragraphs and sections of the law and transforming them into epics and user stories. Figure 2 shows a practical example from an excerpt of Section 2 (3) of the German Income Tax Act (EStG), illustrating how language models can identify relevant information and transform it into functional requirements. The functional requirements can then be further translated into executable code.
